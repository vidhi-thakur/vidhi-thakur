### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Vidhi Thakur

Iâ€™m Vidhi Thakur, a frontend developer who loves solving real-world problems through clean code and thoughtful UI. With 2.5+ years of experience in building web applications using React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Redux, Iâ€™ve built features that not only worked but also made users stay, engage, and convert. Whether itâ€™s reducing drop-offs or streamlining flows, I focus on solving real problems that matter.

Outside of shipping clean code, I love sharpening my problem-solving skills with DSA and experimenting with AI tools to build smarter, faster. I'm the kind of teammate whoâ€™s always up for learning something new and figuring things out together. If you enjoy building with purpose, chances are weâ€™ll get along just fine.
